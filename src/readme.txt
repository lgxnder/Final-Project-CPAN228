everything in this directory should be the actual project directory.

Intellij follows a project hierachy like the following:
	PROJECT_NAME
	    -> src
		-> main
		    -> java
			-> com.humber.PROJECT_NAME
			    -> config,
				controllers,
				models,
				repositories,
				services,
				PROJECT_NAMEApplication.


This directory should mirror the "src" directory in Intellij, and have the "main" folder in it.
