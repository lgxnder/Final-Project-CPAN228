Project Name:  SleepPlanRepeat

Team Members: Alexander Stasyna (N01627582), Lakshman Jairam (N01632359), Noah Go (N01621722)

Application Summary: A web-application that will let a user track individual dates, yearly events, and their hourly schedule, all-in-one. There will be different views. A monthly calendar view, with the ability for the user to click into each day of the month to plan and record a more in-depth overview of their day. The application is to be used as a utility tool, with most of the information provided by the user themselves. The user’s information will be saved in an account that links back to a database. The account’s password will be encrypted using bcrypt.

Backend: Use of a date and time API along with the Model-View-Controller design.
Frontend: We plan to use a mix of ExpressJS and Thymeleaf templating.
Database: A NoSql database, such as Mongo.


We plan to use Git for version control and GitHub as a distributed version control platform to collaborate over.
Right now, we also plan to use either Vercel or Heroku for a free host for our web application; however, we may seek out other alternatives.
